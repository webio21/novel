        <h1>Join a Rare Creative Endeavor</h1>
        <p>We’re reaching out to invite you to be part of a rare creative endeavor—one that spans over 15 years of development and represents one of our most cherished and ambitious projects to date.</p>
        
        <p>This is not just another editing assignment. It’s a milestone work, adapted from a 2019 radio drama, and envisioned as a genre-crossing epic trilogy. The first novel, which we hope to publish later this month, is complete. Two more volumes are planned, with the second scheduled for completion next year.</p>

        <p>We’re currently seeking an editor who shares our passion for storytelling—not someone simply looking to fulfill a task, but a true creative partner who values the opportunity to shape something exceptional.</p>

        <p>Given our limited budget, we are offering <strong>$200 per book</strong> (about 50,000+ words each), totaling <strong>$600 for the trilogy</strong>. We understand this is below professional market rates, and we do not present it lightly. Instead, we see this as a collaborative exchange: a rare, meaningful project for an editor who is drawn to purpose and long-term potential over short-term gain.</p>

        <p>As a seasoned editor, your keen eye will no doubt spot areas for improvement—and that’s exactly what we’re hoping for. Your insight could make a critical difference in bringing this vision to life while preserving its unique structure and voice.</p>

        <p>If you’re intrigued by the idea of editing a story with heart, scope, and creative depth—and you’re open to working within a tight budget in exchange for being part of something that could truly stand out—we’d love to hear from you.</p>
